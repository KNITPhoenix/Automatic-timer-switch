# Automatic-timer-switch
It is a timer that takes time in minutes and seconds as input, displaying that on seven segment display. Thereafter on pressing the start button the timer activates, and switches on the appliance until the time is up. The appliance automatically switches off as soon as the time is up. On little modification, the timer can switch off appliance, instead of switching it on for some time, therefore working in reverse.
The parts required are:
1.Atmega16 microcontroller
2.A 5 volts relay
3.Three seven segment display (common cathode)
4.Three push button to increase the number
5.BC547
6.IN4007
7.Some resistors of 2.2K,10K and 220 ohms.
8.One push button for reset and one push button for start the timer
9.7805 IC
10.16 MHz crystal
11.Zero PCB
12.PCB connectors
13.some capacitors for filter
14.LED to indicate power
